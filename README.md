# Volume3PortfolioProject

Predicting Basketball Game Outcomes

The project has three main parts:

1. Develop an interesting and challenging research question or series of questions that should, in principle, be answerable by a thorough analysis (including using techniques of machine learning and data analytics covered in this class) of a good data set.  Explain the questions clearly, and explain why they are interesting or important.  Extra points may be awarded for problems that contribute to making the world a better place (e.g., helps refugees, reduces accidents, helps better diagnose a disease, etc.)

2. Obtain, clean, describe, and present a data set that should, in principle, be usable to answer the questions in part 1.  This presentation should include good data visualizations and simple data analysis. 

3.  Using the learning techniques introduced in the class, analyze the data in a more thorough way.  This part could include techniques such as regression, forests and boosted trees. Explain why you chose the given techniques and the results from applying them.  If you do this well, it will be a great thing to show potential employers (or graduate schools) to convince them that you can add real value to their organization.

Format: Jupyter Notebook exported to PDF via LaTeX, in the default font and default margins. Explanations should be in markdown and LaTeX (NOT as print statements or code comments, although the code itself should be properly commented).  The final report should be no more than 10 pages using the default fonts and margins that Jupyter notebooks produce for LaTeX, including all graphics and tables and code. Shorter is better: just make sure that you do a good, complete, careful job.
